I worked as a database consultant for a pharmaceutical company
they needed to analyse the prescribing data to understand more about the types of medication being prescribed, the organisations doing the prescribing, and the quantities prescribed
I was given three csv files which contains information on prescriptions which have been issued in England, with the focus on Bolton in greater Manchester.
the first part was to create a database and then I proceeded to give answers to the questions they had.
Part 2:  return details of all drugs which are in the form of tablets or capsules
Part 3: return the total quantity for each of prescriptions
Part 4: return a list of the distinct chemical substances contained in the drugs
Part 5: return the number of prescriptions for each BNF_CHAPTER_PLUS_CODE, along with the average cost for that chapter code, and the minimum and maximum prescription costs for that chapter code
Part 6: return the most expensive prescription prescribed by each practice with the practice name, sorted in descending order by prescription cost. Return only those rows where the most expensive prescription is more than Â£4000.
I also added five queries which i felt will return necessary information to the company
